# Classification-homework

In this homework assignment we began by loading our required libraries and reading our csv files into data frames and then performing basic data cleaning.
We then split the the data into training and testing data and then scaled the data. Then we used different algorithms to determine the best performance between them; such as Simple Logistic Regression, Oversampling, Undersampling, and Combination (Over and Under) Sampling.
We compared the results using Balanced Accuracy Scores, Confusion Matrixes, and Imbalanced Classification Reports.These reports allowed us to determine the best performing algorithms.
